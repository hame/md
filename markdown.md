# Markdown #

Learning to code and writing this book might start at the same place, something called Markdown. 
Created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, this formatting text in a plain text editor.
How? Special text characters have special meanings.


## Simpliest example ##
The cool thing is you just start typing. That's it.

### A real simple example ###
An example with actual Markdown is to format your text
**two for bold** 
_one for italic_ 

### More examples ###
Headings use 1 to 5 #'s
The #'s at the end are my convention, although it is technically not needed, I think it looks more symmetrical

1. An
2. Ordered
3. List

- An
- Unordered
- list

Hyperlink is text followed by the link
[Link text](https://google.com)

And image looks the same but has a ! in front
![Alt text example](https://some/image.png)

And combined write the link first, then insert the image markdown
1. [](https://google.com)
2. [![Image search pic](https:/some/image.png)](https://google.com)

Email addresses with <crocodiles>

Three backticks make a codeblock
```js
console.log('This is a code block');
```

### Extended syntax ###
Tables
| Left | Center | Right |
| ---- | ------ | ----- |
| 1    | 2      | 3     |
Use :--- to left align
Use ---: to right align
Use :--: to center align

Task lists
- [ ] Do stuff
- [ x ] Don't forget the space around x
